About the data files

Attached is some sample HWI
data. There are two files: samples.tsv and experiments.tsv (<TAB>
separated)

samples.tsv = Contains the info on the actual protein samples

experiments.tsv = Contains the experimental data from the screens.
Primary key here would be the plate_no, this will link you back to the
protein samples. 

There are 1536 records (experiments) for each protein (3072 total). This
data represents a single "screen" of the protein at a specific point in
time.  The protein is placed in 1536 wells (cocktails) which makes up
the "screen". Each cocktail is made up a one or more solution components
(chemicals). The chemicals are listed ';' separated in the
"solution_components" column. 

A picture is taken (image_url) of the cocktail and is processed by an
automated classifier. This classifier computes the probabilities for 10
classes. The class with the highest probability wins and is captured in
"class_10way" column. The "verfied_crystal" is 1 if a human has verified
that it's a crystal.
